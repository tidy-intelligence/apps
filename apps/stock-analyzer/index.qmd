This shiny app computes stock-specific return metrics and optimal portfolio weights for your favorite stocks from the S&P 500 index. 

This app is a prototype based on the book [Tidy Finance with R](https://www.tidy-finance.org/) and a submission for the [2024 Table Contest](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-table-contest/) by Posit.

You can find the app on [shinyapps.io](https://christophscheuch.shinyapps.io/app-stock-analyzer/) and the source on [Github](https://github.com/tidy-intelligence/app-stock-analyzer).
